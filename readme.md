## Project

### Problem Statement
Do you love festivals? Do you hear about new ones from friends and family but have a hard time keeping track of them all?
Are you the organizer of a festival but need help getting the word out about your event? 
Wisconsin has many wonderful festivals, but as an individual it is hard to keep track of them all. As an organizer, it 
can be hard to reach all of your potential attendees. 
The Wisconsin Festival Tracker can help you find all the festivals that you wish to attend. You can find festivals 
of a certain type or in a specific region. As an organizer(or festival goer) you can add a festival so that others 
can find it and attend.
